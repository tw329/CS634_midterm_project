# CS634_midterm_project
This is a midterm project of cs634.

There are **two** python files. One is used to generate random transactions, and the other one is the apriori algorithm.

In generate_data.py, I first give a list of items I mentioned in the milestone report and a list of numbers so that the distribution of the data won't be too evenly.

In algorithm.py there is the apriori algorithm. Allow users to enter the file they want and the mini support and the mini confidence.

The result print out in the format:

item(s) -> item(s) sup: support conf: confidence
